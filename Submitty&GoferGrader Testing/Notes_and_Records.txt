Getting to know Anaconda, Git, and Jupyter

	- Download the Anaconda platform
	- Figure out how to download Carme for Linux (very different from Mac)
	- Learn about the Carme environment, how to set it up, and its purpose
	- Learn about GitHub access control
        * How to clone repositories
        * How to add files from repo
        * How to commit files from repo
        * How to pull/fetch files from repo
        * How to push to the remote repo

	- Manipulate and experiment with the Submitty grading functionality and architecture
        * Submitty autogrades with output comparisons between output of student code and output of professor code
        
	- Manipulate and experiment with OKPY (Gofer Grader) file interactions with JupyterLab
	  (JupyterHub)
        * Gofer Grader autogrades with a configuration JSON file that looks at the printing of the code with the answer depicted in the configuration file (Similar to a Python doctest procedure)

Jupyter Notebook running issues
	- Update pip to the latest version even if it is downloaded off the official website
    - Update git to the latest version should there be any access errors
        * e.g. Access forbidden errors
	- "No module named client error" -> download gofer grader
        * Gofer grader is needed to access .ok files when working with a .ipynb file or .py file.
    - "Missing Pandoc Error" -> download the Pandoc package that can be found online 
        * Carme and Jupyter utilize this package to convert between markup and code forms, such as converting a .ipynb file to a .py file
	- "Missing PyHamcrest Error" -> Gofer grader requires pip as well as PyHamcrest (if you do not already have it)
        * PyHamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects, which are used to write flexible tests for specific files.

Steps to the utilizing the gofer grader autograder 
(sub-application of OKPY)

(1) Use carme to convert notebook from a .ipynb to a .py file.
(2) Run the .py file.
(3) Look at the config file. Loop through and run each test using a try and catch.
(4) output the results of tests into a CSV (TESTNUM , PTS, PTSREC, OUTPUT)
(5) Simplify the sample to potentially include only 2 tests.
