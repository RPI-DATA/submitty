Running the following cell will test whether you have assigned `seconds_in_a_decade` correctly in Question 3.2. If you haven't, this test will tell you the correct answer. Resist the urge to just copy it, and instead try to adjust your expression. (Sometimes the tests will give hints about what went wrong...)"
