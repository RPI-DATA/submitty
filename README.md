## Sample Autograding 

The goal of this is to provide an autograding example which integrates OKPY and submitty. 

A foundational component is a standard docker container which can be used for both running the assignment and checking the assignment. 

This example comes from the [binder-examples](https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyter-stacks) repository.
